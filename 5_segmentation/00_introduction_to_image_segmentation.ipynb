    "\n",
    "segmenting an image means partitioning an image into different regions of homogenous pixels such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- union of all regions = the image\n",
    "- each region is homogeneous. homogeneity can be based on criteria based on the problem one is trying to solve.\n",
    "- any pair of distinct regions is not homogeneous\n",
    "- regions shuld have low internal variance\n",
    "- regions should be made of spatially contiguous pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "These points are derived from **[Pavlidis's definitions of segmentation](https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring06/cps296.1/handouts/Horowitz%20Pavlidis%201976.pdf)**"

    "\n",
    "Segmenting an image gives us a class mapping for each pixel in that image. This enables us to have precise understanding and control of the scene. When self driving car sees a segmented camera feed it knows precisely which pixels belong to road and which pixel belong to human. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus making the decision logic easier to implement - _Stay on the road pixels, stay away from human pixels and maintain a safe distance from other vehicle pixels_.\n",
