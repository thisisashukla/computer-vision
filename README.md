## Acknowledgement

I dedicate this work to my teacher [Prof. B. Krishna Mohan](http://www.csre.iitb.ac.in/bkmohan/), who is the source of whatever little I know of this amazing field called Computer Vision and under whom I have completed my master's degree.

## About the Content

This notebook series is a collection of Jupyter notebooks organized in chapters, covering some of the most interesting and useful topics of Computer Vision.

This series focuses on presenting concepts as organically connected tools to solve different problems related to RGB images. And give to develop an understanding in the reader about how different concepts are tied together to implement one image analytics solution.

The notebooks presented here are a blend of theory and code to balance between understanding and implementation.

## Objectives

The objective of this notebook series is to make the reader comfortable with different concepts of image processing using traditional and neural network based techniques.

## Software Pre-requisites

You will need a Python environment with OpenCV, Jupyter notebooks, Keras, Tensorflow installed.

Use the requirements.txt in the repo.

## Knowledge Pre-requisites

Working knowledge of Python and Jupyter notebooks is essential for this course. Hands-on experience with OpenCV and Keras will also be helpful.
